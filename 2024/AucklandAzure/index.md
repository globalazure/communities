We're excited to be hosting an event at the **[Aotearoa Azure Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/auckland-azure-usergroup/)** in Auckland!

We are having a hybrid lunch session to talk about Azure!

Expect great sessions covering AI, security, identity, developer technologies, devops and beyond.

This is also a great chance to network with MVPs and experts in the Azure world.

Talks will be delivered to our live audience and streamed through Microsoft Teams.
